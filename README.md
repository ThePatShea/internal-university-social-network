# Internal University Social Network

#### Product Description
This web app is an internal social network for university organizations to collaborate on projects. Any club, dorm, fraternity/sorority, or sports team could create a group to discuss projects, post events, and upload/share files.

#### See the Web App
This web app is no longer online, but you can still view some images of it. These are mockups, but screenshots would look identical, because I'm awesome at front end.

**View the images:**
- The [Home](https://d2p9ez1wat05y7.cloudfront.net/portfolio_assets/62964/pictures/1435029931/original.png) page. Here, students could accept/decline invites to new groups, check updates from their existing groups, and see the hottest topics that all the groups on campus were discussing.
- The [Group Dashboard](https://d2p9ez1wat05y7.cloudfront.net/portfolio_assets/63028/pictures/1435072888/original.png) page. Here, members of clubs would view events/discussions/files posted by their fellow club members.
- The [Group Event](https://d2p9ez1wat05y7.cloudfront.net/portfolio_assets/63036/pictures/1435073521/original.png) page. Here, students would view the details of an event hosted by their club, write comments, and declare whether or not they'd attend the event.
- The [Edit Group](https://d2p9ez1wat05y7.cloudfront.net/portfolio_assets/63026/pictures/1435072032/original.png) page. Here, students would approve/deny new member requests, upgrade/downgrade existing members from admin status, and modify the group's name/category/profile picture.

#### Disclaimer
I made most of my commits on this repo using another Github account called "campus-bubble". This was the account I used back when I was still working with my old company. If you'd like to verify this, please contact Campus Bubble's Chief of Product, Giovanni Hobbins: giovanni@campusbubble.com

#### Technologies Utilized
- Node.js stack including Express/MongoDB/Jade
- Several back-end node modules
- Several front-end Javascript libraries
- Fully responsive UI from desktop to mobile
- PhoneGap for iOS/Android apps
- Facebook API for user authentication
- Stripe API. At one point, I implemented a feature that allowed local businesses to pay for an account to post deals, but I decided to cut that feature from the final product.
