#### Disclaimer
I made most of my commits on this repo using another Github account called "campus-bubble". This was the account I used back when I was still working with my old company. If you'd like to verify this, please contact Campus Bubble's Chief of Product, Giovanni Hobbins: giovanni@campusbubble.com

#### Technologies Utilized
- Node.js stack including Express/MongoDB/Jade
- Several back-end node modules
- Several front-end Javascript libraries
- Fully responsive UI from desktop to mobile
- PhoneGap for iOS/Android apps
- Facebook API for user authentication
- Stripe API. At one point, I implemented a feature that allowed local businesses to pay for an account to post deals, but I decided to cut that feature from the final product.
